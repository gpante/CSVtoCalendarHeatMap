# CSVtoCalendarHeatMap
Tranforms a CSV of dates and values into a calendar heat map

Create a CSV file with dates as the column and values as the second column. The dates should be sequential and empty dates should be filled with zeroes in the second column.

Download csvtoheatmap.py and navigate to the appropriate directory via command line and ensure the CSV is in the same directory.
Ensure all requirements are satisfied.

Run "python csvtoheatmap.py [csv file]" with the name of the csv file you've created.
